### Problem

  ["Michelle Maquiling, officer-in-charge of the PRC-Negros Oriental Chapter, said there is a dire need for blood donors    because there are patients who need blood every day, but there is a shortage of supply even if the DOH has programs to strengthen blood donation in the province."](http://www.philstar.com/region/2017/03/28/1685367/blood-donors-dearth-due-fear-needles) <br/><br/>
  ["For a first class hospital like St. Luke’s to suffer from shortage of blood supply means public hospitals are more blood-challenged nationwide from source analysed"](http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/philippines/blood-shortage-affecting-hospitals-in-philippines-1.1657914)<br/><br/>
  ["Blood needed: With PH blood supply below target, patients seek help online.
With the Philippines' blood supply still falling short of the target, patients in need of blood turn to online networks to look for kind-hearted strangers willing to donate"](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/180446-blood-donation-online-networks-philippine-red-cross)
